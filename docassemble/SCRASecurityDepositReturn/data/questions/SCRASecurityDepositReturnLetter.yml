  SCRA Security Deposit Return Letter
subquestion: |
 If you are in the Armed Forces, Reserves, National Guard, or other uniformed services, you and your family have legal protections when you're called to active duty. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides many of those protections.

  One protection related to housing leases says that if you ended your lease legally under the SCRA, your landlord has to return your security deposit (minus any damages) within 30 days of when the lease ended.
 
  This letter is for servicemembers or their dependents who have lawfully ended their lease using the SCRA and the landlord has failed to return their security deposit.
 
  <b>Please Note: This is not legal advice.</b> If you have questions about a landlord keeping part or all of your security deposit, you should contact a lawyer. You can [search for legal assistance](https://www.statesidelegal.org/stateside-map) at StatesideLegal's Find Legal Help tool. 
  
   You can learn more about the SCRA in the video [What is the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act?](https://www.statesidelegal.org/what-servicemembers-civil-relief-act-video) at StatesideLegal.org.
